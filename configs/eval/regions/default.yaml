# Region-specific evaluation configuration
# Enables detailed analysis of model performance across antibody regions

# Enable region-specific evaluation
enabled: false

# Evaluation mode:
# - "per_position": Mask one position at a time, aggregate by region (most detailed)
# - "region_level": Mask entire regions at once (faster, tests region reconstruction)
mode: per_position

# Regions to include in evaluation
# null = all regions, or specify a list:
# ["cdr1_h", "cdr2_h", "cdr3_h", "cdr1_l", "cdr2_l", "cdr3_l",
#  "fw1_h", "fw2_h", "fw3_h", "fw4_h", "fw1_l", "fw2_l", "fw3_l", "fw4_l"]
include: null

# Batch size for per-position evaluation
# Higher values = faster but more memory
position_batch_size: 32

# Aggregation strategies for results
# - "all": Individual regions (cdr1_h_acc, cdr2_h_acc, ...)
# - "cdr": CDRs vs frameworks (cdr_acc, fw_acc)
# - "fw": Same as "cdr" (alias)
# - "chain": Heavy vs light (heavy_acc, light_acc)
# - "region_type": By CDR/FW number across chains (cdr1_acc, cdr2_acc, cdr3_acc, fw1_acc, ...)
aggregate:
  - all
  - cdr
