# Power schedule parameter (only used when schedule_type=power)
# Higher power = lower average masking rate
# power=4.0 gives ~20% avg masking, power=5.0 gives ~17%

# Higher values increase the probability of masking those positions

# Masking selection method for information-weighted masking
# - "ranked": Deterministically select top-K highest-weighted positions
# - "sampled": Probabilistically sample using Gumbel-top-k (recommended)

# Curriculum learning for timestep sampling
# When enabled, training starts by sampling from a limited timestep range (lower masking)
# and gradually expands to the full range as training progresses
